## Cisco IOS (Interface Operating System)
#### In wikipedia
> The IOS command line interface provides a fixed set of multiple-word commands. The set available is determined by the "mode" and the > > > privilege level of the current user. "Global configuration mode" provides commands to change the system's configuration, and "interface > configuration mode" provides commands to change the configuration of a specific interface. All commands are assigned a privilege level, > from 0 to 15, and can only be accessed by users with the necessary privilege. Through the CLI, the commands available to each privilege > level can be defined.
